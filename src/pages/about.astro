	<Card variant="border">
		I'm not very experienced with programming yet, but I'm very interested
		in it.<br />
		Whenever I come up with a project idea, I bring it to life with the help
		of AI tools. <br />
		This makes the coding process a lot more fun and manageable for me.<br
		/><br />

		When it comes to music, I especially enjoy upbeat and cheerful Japanese
		songs, which always help keep me motivated.<br />
		One of my favorite artists is Hatsune Miku. <br />
		Listening to music is one of my favorite ways to relax and unwind.<br
		/><br />

		I'm also really into watching anime, which has become a big hobby of
		mine. <br />
		I'm especially interested in romantic comedy series.<br />
		Anime offers a great window into creative storytelling and different cultures.
		<br />
		I love discovering new shows and chatting about my favorite characters.<br
		/><br />

		I’m not that into gaming, but I play a few games sometimes just to pass
		the time. <br />
		I'm usually drawn to gacha games like Wuthering Waves and Genshin Impact.
		<br />
		Occasionally, I also check out lighter, more casual games, such as Roblox
		and Osu!.<br /><br />

		Also, I have a pretty bad drawing skill — but I still like doodling for
		fun from time to time. :3<br />
